Working on RailSafe gave us hands-on experience in integrating IoT hardware, cloud platforms, and AI/ML models into a real-world safety-critical system. We learned how to design a modular architecture that can scale from prototype to production, while ensuring low-latency communication and robust security for mission-critical railway operations. The project deepened our understanding of sensor fusion, TinyML, predictive maintenance, and real-time alerting workflows, while also highlighting the importance of user-centric design for both control room operators and train drivers. Most importantly, this journey taught us the value of team collaboration, rapid prototyping, and iterative problem-solving in building impactful solutions for public safety.
